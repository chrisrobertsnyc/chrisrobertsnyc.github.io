**XSAVI 800**

I developed a few maps for the Advanced Web Mapping class I took at Pratt.

[_Neighboring Neighborhood Map of Brooklyn_](http://chrisroberts.nyc/xsavi800/ass4.html)

When you click on an official neighborhood of Brooklyn, the area of the neighborhood is calculated, and adjacent neighborhoods are highlighted. The map has a customized Mapbox basemap and used five GIS operations through TurfJS to find the other neighborhoods.

[_Viewing ESRI data in a Leaflet map_](http://chrisroberts.nyc/xsavi800/final/newmap.html)

At work I deal with Esri's software and proprietary data formats. I like Leaflet's javascript API a lot more than ESRI's, so I research ways to work with ESRI data through open source APIs. The result is this map, which displays spatial data from an ArcServer feature service; when a point is clicked, the record is queried in a related table for more data.
