**XSAVI 800**

I developed a few maps for the Advanced Web Mapping class I took at Pratt.

[_Neighboring Neighborhood Map of Brooklyn_](http://chrisroberts.nyc/xsavi800/ass4.html)

When you click on an official neighborhood of Brooklyn, the area of the neighborhood is calculated, and adjacent neighborhoods are highlighted. The map has a customized Mapbox basemap and used five GIS operations through TurfJS to find the other neighborhoods.
