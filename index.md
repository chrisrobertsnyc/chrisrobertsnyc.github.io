### About me
I'm a GIS specialist and assistant planner for the [Division of Planning](http://www.hudsoncountynj.org/about-the-division-of-planning/) of Hudson County, New Jersey. I'm also finishing up a Master's degree in urban planning at [Hunter College](http://hunteruap.org/).

### About this site
This site is for my own personal development, as well as a bit of fun. It's always going to be a work in progress, so some pages may look polished, but then you might click on a link and get a 404 error.
I think maps are pretty darn cool, so this site will act partially as a repository for my mapping efforts. And when I have more free time after I'm done with grad school, I'd like to start blogging again.
